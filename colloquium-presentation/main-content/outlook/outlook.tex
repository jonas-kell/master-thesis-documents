        \begin{exampleblock}{Conclusion:}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Successfully transferred and validated the theory
                \item Working implementation
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Extensively tested
                    \item Configurable and extensible
                \end{itemize}
                \item Started validating expectations with measurements on the compute cluster
            \end{itemize}

        \begin{block}{Outlook:}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Re-write in lower level language to gain performance over Python
                \item Start more real experiments now that the theory is validated to work
            \end{itemize}
        \end{block}

            Conclusion:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Managed to Solve all problems 
                \item Provide heavily \emph{tested} and \emph{extensible} library of code AND theoretical summary
                \item Started to validate expectations with computations on the cluster
            \end{itemize}

            Future plans:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item re-write in performant language after testing is successful
                \item Go through the parameters to start investigating the behavior of the systems
            \end{itemize}
