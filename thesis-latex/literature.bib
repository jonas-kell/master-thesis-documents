This bound can only be attained for one-particle states {\textbar}φ⟩ with equal amplitudes with respect to the hard-core basis (sites) and when the corresponding N-particle state {\textbar}Ψ⟩ is maximally delocalized. This result is generalized to the maximum condensate possible within a given sublattice. We observe that such maximal local condensation is only possible if the mode entanglement between the sublattice and its complement is minimal. We also show that the maximizing state {\textbar}Ψ⟩ is related to the ground state of a bosonic “Hubbard star” showing Bose-Einstein condensation.},

It is possible, simply by formal properties of exponential functions, to generaiize to a great extent the concepts of cumulants and cumulant function. The stochastic variables to be considered need not be ordinary c -numbers but they may be q -numbers such as used in quantum mechanics. The exponential function which defines a moment generating function may be any kind of generalized exponential, for example an ordered exponential with a certain prescription for ordering q -number variables. The definition of average may be greatly generalized as far as the condition is fulfilled that the average of unity is unity. After statements of a few basic theorems these generalizations are discussed here with certain examples of application. This generalized cumulant expansion provides us with a point of view from which many existent methods in quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics can be unified.},

	abstract = {Dynamics in correlated quantum matter is a hard problem, as its exact solution generally involves a computational effort that grows exponentially with the number of constituents. While remarkable progress has been witnessed in recent years for one-dimensional systems, much less has been achieved for interacting quantum models in higher dimensions, since they incorporate an additional layer of complexity. In this work, we employ a variational method that allows for an efficient and controlled computation of the dynamics of quantum many-body systems in one and higher dimensions. The approach presented here introduces a variational class of wave functions based on complex networks of classical spins akin to artificial neural networks, which can be constructed in a controlled fashion. We provide a detailed prescription for such constructions and illustrate their performance by studying quantum quenches in one- and two-dimensional models. In particular, we investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of a genuinely interacting two-dimensional lattice gauge theory, the quantum link model, for which we have recently shown—employing the technique discussed thoroughly in this paper—that it features disorder-free localization dynamics [P. Karpov et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 126, 130401 (2021)]. The present work not only supplies a framework to address purely theoretical questions but also could be used to provide a theoretical description of experiments in quantum simulators, which have recently seen an increased effort targeting two-dimensional geometries. Importantly, our method can be applied to any quantum many-body system with a well-defined classical limit.},

We introduce a variational representation of quantum states based on artificial neural networks with a variable number of hidden neurons.

In this work we present a versatile and efficient machine learning inspired approach based on a recently introduced artificial neural network encoding of quantum many-body wave functions. We identify and resolve key challenges for the simulation of time evolution, which previously imposed significant limitations on the accurate description of large systems and long-time dynamics. As a concrete example, we study the dynamics of the paradigmatic two-dimensional transverse-field Ising model, as recently also realized experimentally in systems of Rydberg atoms. Calculating the nonequilibrium real-time evolution across a broad range of parameters, we, for instance, observe collapse and revival oscillations of ferromagnetic order and demonstrate that the reached timescales are comparable to or exceed the capabilities of state-of-the-art tensor network methods.},

We find strong lattice effects near half filling. An effective quantum mechanical description of the vortex degrees of freedom is derived. Using semiclassical and numerical analysis we compute the vortex hopping energy, which at half filling is close to magnitude of the boson hopping energy. The critical quantum melting density of the vortex lattice is estimated at 6.5x10-5 vortices per unit cell. The Hall conductance is computed from the Chern numbers of the low energy eigenstates. At zero temperature, it reverses sign abruptly at half filling. At precisely half filling, all eigenstates are doubly degenerate for any odd number of flux quanta. We prove the exact degeneracies on the torus by constructing an {SU}(2) algebra of point-group symmetries, associated with the center of vorticity. This result is interpreted as if each vortex carries an internal spin-half degree of freedom ('vspin'), which can manifest itself as a charge density modulation in its core. Our findings suggest interesting experimental implications for vortex motion of cold atoms in optical lattices, and magnet-transport of short coherence length superconductors.},

	abstract = {Combining insights from machine learning and quantum Monte Carlo, the stochastic reconfiguration method with neural network Ansatz states is a promising new direction for high-precision ground-state estimation of quantum many-body problems. Even though this method works well in practice, little is known about the learning dynamics. In this paper, we bring to light several hidden details of the algorithm by analyzing the learning landscape. In particular, the spectrum of the quantum Fisher matrix of complex restricted Boltzmann machine states exhibits a universal initial dynamics, but the converged spectrum can dramatically change across a phase transition. In contrast to the spectral properties of the quantum Fisher matrix, the actual weights of the network at convergence do not reveal much information about the system or the dynamics. Furthermore, we identify a measure of correlation in the state by analyzing entanglement in eigenvectors. We show that, generically, the learning landscape modes with least entanglement have largest eigenvalue, suggesting that correlations are encoded in large flat valleys of the learning landscape, favoring stable representations of the ground state.},

This review traces the trajectory of the subfield solid state physics through the experiences of the author in relationship to major university departments and Bell Labs, with digressions into how he became a physicist, physics education, and choosing research problems.},
