This part of the thesis is supposed to give a general overview about used methods for the implementation of the so-far theoretical methods.
The entire codebase employs several strategies to arrive at a working and configurable end result and not all parts of it can be touched upon in detail.
It also does not make sense to include most parts of the code in this thesis, it is best viewed in the provided reference \cite{selfCode}.
Key parts and methods will be briefly presented, as while taking the same amount of work to create, the code does not make for nearly as much content as the analytical theory.
