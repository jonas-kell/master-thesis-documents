The system in question is described by a \emph{Hubbard model Hamiltonian}, that includes an electrical field. It is shown in \autoref{eq:main-hamiltonian}.


\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:main-hamiltonian}
    \pictureHamiltonian = \HzeroHamiltonian + \Vhamiltonian
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:main-hamiltonian-h0}
    \HzeroHamiltonian = U \cdot \lsum \nop{l}{\up}\nop{l}{\down} + \lsum[l,\,\sigma] \underbrace{\left(\vec{E} \cdot \vec{r_l}\right)}_{\text{\normalsize \epsl}} \nop{l}{\sigma}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:main-hamiltonian-perturbation}
    \Vhamiltonian =  - J \cdot \neighborsumWSpin{l}{m}{\sigma} \left(\withspinhcop{l}{\sigma}{\dagger} \withspinhcop{m}{\sigma}{} + \withspinhcop{m}{\sigma}{\dagger} \withspinhcop{l}{\sigma}{} \right)
\end{equation}

$\vec{E}$ describes the vector of said electrical field and $\vec{r_l}$ the position of the site with index $l$.
The number operators $\nop{l}{\sigma} = \withspinhcop{l}{\sigma}{\dagger}\withspinhcop{l}{\sigma}{}$ measure the occupation on site $l$ with the respective spin $\sigma$. 

$U$, $J$ and \epsl[] are constants that describe the interaction strength. 
They all have the unit of energy. 
The scalar product that is defined as \epsl[] can be evaluated, based on the system geometry. 
In this case, the system is described by a regular square pattern that can be seen in \autoref{fig:geometry-of-square-system}. 
For such a system, the energy difference that is acquired from hopping from site $l$ to $m$ ($\Delta E_{l \rightarrow m}$) (provided, $l$ and $m$ are nearest neighbors) is described by \autoref{eq:energy-difference-hopping}. By assuming a default value for \epsl[0], one gets the relation from \autoref{eq:epsl} for \epsl{} (using the telescoping sum over nearest-neighbors-hopping along the path from $\vec{r_0}$ to $\vec{r_l}$).

    \caption{Graphical representation of how the examined square system is laid out. The sites are labeled with the index $l$, they later can be identified by. Each of the sites has 4 nearest neighbors, except the ones on the borders, that have 3 or only 2 nearest neighbors (as the system is not periodic). A system of side length $M$ with size $N$ is depicted, which means that it has $M^2 = N$ sites.
    In green, the Electrical field vector $\vec{E}$ is depicted, it is parametrized by the field strength $E$ and the angle $\varphi$.}

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:energy-difference-hopping}
    \begin{split}
        \Delta E_{l \rightarrow m} &=  \epsl[m] - \epsl[l] = \vec{E} \cdot \left(\vec{r_m}-\vec{r_l}\right)\\
        &= E \cdot \left[\cos(\varphi)\cdot \left(m \% M-l \% M\right) + \sin(\varphi)\cdot \left(\floor[\bigg]{\frac{m}{M}}-\floor[\bigg]{\frac{l}{M}}\right)\right]
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
\vspace{0.5cm} % equations are not well enough separated otherwise
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:epsl}
    \begin{split}
        \epsl[0] = 0 \Rightarrow
        \epsl[l] &= \epsl[l] - \epsl[0] = \Delta E_{0 \rightarrow x} + \dots + \Delta E_{y \rightarrow l}\\
        &= E \cdot \left[\cos(\varphi)\cdot l \% M + \sin(\varphi)\cdot \floor[\bigg]{\frac{l}{M}}\right]
    \end{split}
\end{equation}

During measurements in the \nameref{sec:experiments-numerical} section, a one-dimensional version of this is used, that will be labeled \emph{chain}. 
It will be obtained by cutting the first row of the respective square geometry and is consistent with basically all mathematical derivations performed for the \emph{square} case, because of the nearest-neighbor notation that is independent of the underlying geometry. Only in the derivation of \fullref{sec:theory-observables-current} differences based on the dimensionality appear, however they do not affect the end result.
The reason for the truncation is to reduce thy system size for the verification of convergence towards exact comparisons.
While such a modification necessarily affects the physical properties, it is fine for verification of convergence.
Also interesting physical - system-size independent - effects only manifest in experiments with lattice site numbers far beyond any possible exact diagonalization anyway.

The Hubbard model \cite{hubbardModelOriginalDerivation} is a spin-dependent quantum-mechanical model. 
Because of this, the Hamiltonian includes terms for both the spin directions $\up$ and $\down$ (most of the time denoted by a summation over $\sigma$).

In principle, the operators $\withspinhcop[]{l}{\sigma}{(\dagger)}$ can be any type of quantum-mechanical ladder operator, like the aforementioned bosonic or fermionic ones.
In this application the decision was made to use \emph{hard-core bosons} \cite[]{hardCoreBosonsBasics} for they happen to obey multiple useful properties.

Typically for bosons, the Hubbard model is transformed into the \emph{Bose-Hubbard model} \cite{boseHubbardModelOriginalDerivation}.
However, hard-core bosons have the added property that they can only have the occupation numbers of $0$ and $1$ per-spin-and-site in the investigated energy range.
This means they behave like fermions, only that their wave-function symmetrizes instead of anti-symmetrizes \cite{schwablBook}.
Because of the restriction, one term of the Bose-Hubbard model drops out and the studied model in equations \ref{eq:main-hamiltonian}, \ref{eq:main-hamiltonian-h0} and \ref{eq:main-hamiltonian-perturbation} is produced.
Also, the typical Bose-Hubbard model is not spin-dependent, while this property is kept here.
Hard-core bosons on their own have relevant properties that make them worth studying. 
Experimental research on hard-core bosons can give insight into e.g. \emph{ultra-cold gasses} and \emph{Bose-Einstein condensation} \cite{hardCoreBosonsBasics}. 
In this case it is important for the following derivations, that the operators on different sites commute, the number operator is idempotent (\ref{eq:hc-counting-op-idempotent}) and can be mapped to spin-basis notation (\ref{eq:jordan-wigner-spin-hcb}).

When adjusting the commutation-relations in \autoref{eq:hard-core-commutators} for spin-dependency \autoref{eq:commutation-relations} is obtained.

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:commutation-relations}
    \begin{split}
        \left[\withspinhcop[]{l}{\sigma}{},\,\withspinhcop[]{l'}{\sigma'}{}\right] &= 
        \left[\withspinhcop[]{l}{\sigma}{\dagger},\,\withspinhcop[]{l'}{\sigma'}{\dagger}\right] = 0\\
        \left[\withspinhcop[]{l}{\sigma}{},\,\withspinhcop[]{l'}{\sigma'}{\dagger}\right] &= 
        \left(1 - 2 \cdot \withspinhcop[]{l}{\sigma}{\dagger}\withspinhcop[]{l}{\sigma}{} \right) \cdot \delta_{l,\,l'}\cdot\delta_{\sigma,\sigma'}
    \end{split}
\end{equation}

For ease of notation, the two spin degrees of freedom may be described by the alternate naming scheme provided in \autoref{eq:alt-naming-scheme}.
The related code implementation, comments and some calculations in linked material \cite{selfCode} use the letters c and d, as that used to be the first designation wile the thesis was developed.

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:alt-naming-scheme}
    \withspinhcop{l}{\up}{(\dagger)} \leftrightarrow \hop{l}{(\dagger)}
    \qquad\qquad
    \withspinhcop{l}{\down}{(\dagger)} \leftrightarrow \dop{l}{(\dagger)}
\end{equation}

For simplification purposes, the two spin directions are assumed to have the same coupling constants ($U$, $J$ and \epsl).
This means, all later results \emph{must} be symmetrical in terms of the spin directions $\up$ and $\down$.


Translated into the alternative notation, \autoref{eq:main-hamiltonian-h0} reads like \autoref{eq:main-hamiltonian-h0-alt-notation} and \autoref{eq:main-hamiltonian-perturbation} reads like \autoref{eq:main-hamiltonian-perturbation-alt-notation}.

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:main-hamiltonian-h0-alt-notation}
    \HzeroHamiltonian = U \cdot \lsum \hop[]{l}{\dagger}\hop[]{l}{} \dop[]{l}{\dagger}\dop[]{l}{} + \lsum\epsl \hop[]{l}{\dagger}\hop[]{l}{} + \lsum\epsl \dop[]{l}{\dagger}\dop[]{l}{}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:main-hamiltonian-perturbation-alt-notation}
    \Vhamiltonian =  - J \cdot \neighborsum{l}{m} \left(\hop[]{l}{\dagger}\hop[]{m}{} +\hop[]{m}{\dagger}\hop[]{l}{} + \dop[]{l}{\dagger}\dop[]{m}{} +\dop[]{m}{\dagger}\dop[]{l}{} \right)
\end{equation}

Several of the previous equations feature the \emph{nearest neighbor} summing notation with pointy brackets $\langle\rangle$.
This is supposed to express, that in the case of $\neighborsum[]{l}{m}$ for each possible $l$, $m$ will take on the indices of all neighbor sites of $l$.
However, if a pair $l=x,\,m=y$ is part of the sum, then the inverse $l=y,\,m=x$ will not be.
To be more in-line with the code implementation, \autoref{eq:fullneigborsum} gives an alternative notation using $[]$.
In such sums, each pair $l=x,\,m=y$ and $l=y,\,m=x$ will be included in the sum for each nearest-neighbor-relation $x,\,y$.

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:fullneigborsum}
    \begin{split}
        &\neighborsum[]{l}{m} \left( F(l,m)\, \hop[]{l}{\dagger}\hop[]{m}{} + F(m,l)\, \hop[]{m}{\dagger}\hop[]{l}{} \right) \stackrel{\stackrel{\text{\scriptsize rename-swap}}{\text{$l$ and $m$}}}{=} \\
        &\neighborsum[]{l}{m} F(l,m)\, \hop[]{l}{\dagger}\hop[]{m}{} + \neighborsum[]{m}{l} F(l,m)\, \hop[]{l}{\dagger}\hop[]{m}{} = \\
        &\fullneighborsum[]{l}{m} F(l,m)\, \hop[]{l}{\dagger}\hop[]{m}{} \stackrel{\text{! caution !}}{\neq}
        2 \cdot \neighborsum[]{l}{m} F(l,m)\, \hop[]{l}{\dagger}\hop[]{m}{}
    \end{split}
\end{equation}

With that convention, it is possible to rewrite \autoref{eq:main-hamiltonian-perturbation-alt-notation} to \autoref{eq:main-hamiltonian-perturbation-full-sum}.

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:main-hamiltonian-perturbation-full-sum}
    \begin{split}
        \Vhamiltonian =  - J \cdot \fullneighborsum{l}{m} \left(\hop[]{l}{\dagger}\hop[]{m}{} + \dop[]{l}{\dagger}\dop[]{m}{} \right)
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
