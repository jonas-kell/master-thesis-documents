Some parts of \fullref{sec:theory} were first written for a \emph{practical training report}\\ \filepath{\cite{selfDocument}}{/practical-training-latex} that was part of initial works on the thesis-subject.
The calculations and text was supplemented and adapted for this final thesis. 
How the parts have been adapted, as well as the original author being the thesis author, can be verified in the version history of the repository \cite{selfDocument}.

In the first part of this thesis, the theoretical background of the researched \emph{Hubbard model} is outlined and the computational problem of gaining information about the \emph{time-evolution} is presented.
Then existing perturbative approximation algorithms are adapted to the relevant geometry, to attempt to provide a method of calculating time-dependent behavior of the present quantum-mechanical system.
Details to the exact scientific question are introduced, after the basics have been defined.
