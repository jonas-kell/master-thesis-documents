While the optimizations described in the previous section greatly increase computational efficiency, they need to be applied for each order and each $\Phi_\ast(N)$ separately.
The problem is, that for two dimensions the number of interactions to consider grows quickly, while visualizing the symmetries of what terms are equivalent gets progressively harder.
When looking at a chain, each higher order expands the interaction range by a one-site-step. 
So taking one more order into account, two sites are added to the possibilities for each interaction - this linearity is still somewhat manageable.
In two dimensions, the number of affected sites in relation to the interaction range grows quadratically, as visualized in \autoref{fig:growing-interaction-range}.
