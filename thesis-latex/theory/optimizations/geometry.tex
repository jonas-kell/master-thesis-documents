While the optimizations described in the previous section greatly increase computational efficiency, they need to be applied for each $\HNOft$-order and each $\Phi_\ast(N)$ separately.
The problem is, that for two dimensions the number of interactions to consider grows quickly, while visualizing the symmetries of what terms are equivalent gets progressively harder.
When looking at a chain, each higher order expands the interaction range by a one-site-step. 
So taking one more order into account, two sites are added to the possibilities for each interaction - this linearity is still somewhat manageable.
In two dimensions, the number of affected sites in relation to the interaction range grows quadratically, as visualized in \autoref{fig:growing-interaction-range}.

As show in \fullref{sec:theory-optimizations-analytical}, the described methods require calculating the differences between the effective Hamiltonians on two states that only differ in localized modifications.
Each modification flips the occupation of at least one site. 
To guarantee the differences of the effective Hamiltonians are evaluated correctly, only the terms that contain a modified site-occupation need to be evaluated. 
The terms that only contain non-modified occupation-numbers are guaranteed to cancel.

For the zeroth-order (base-energy) this is swiftly calculated and can be written down in simple terms like in e.g. equations \ref{eq:new-n-flipping} or \ref{eq:simplified-base-energy-hopping}.
In the case of the first order, it is simple enough to identify the terms.
Looking back at \autoref{eq:hn-integrated-first-order}, it becomes clear, that all terms are described by \emph{edges} of two adjacent sites.
These relevant edges are colored red and orange in \autoref{fig:growing-interaction-range}. 
The symmetry is clear enough to spot that all horizontal and vertical edges respectively have the same analytical value, as $\VhamiltonianAnalyticalPartIntegrated{$\ast$}{l}{m}{t}$ is translationally invariant and are complex conjugates of each other when inverting the indices - which is the reason for arriving at $2\cdot 3 \cdot 2 = 12$ terms in \autoref{eq:psi-and-c-choices}, of which 6 are identified in \autoref{table:first-order-identification} (times two for horizontal/vertical versions).

Looking at all 16 occupation-number-combinations, the complexity is already extreme. 
Some combinations contribute to no terms, some contribute multiple times and some terms have more states contributing to them, some less.
Identifying and analytically optimizing the first order therefore is \emph{just} possible, albeit complicated.
For the variational parametrization, it would be possible and maybe even more efficient to just have 16 parameters, mapping one to one onto the occupation-number-combination of the respective bond. 
In second order however this all breaks down.
Taking a second look at \autoref{fig:growing-interaction-range}, each term in \autoref{eq:hn-integrated-second-order-final} now corresponds to an \emph{adjacent pair of connections}, of which are ?? different possible ones (assuming no edge-cases).
