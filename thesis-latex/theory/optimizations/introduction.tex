While at this point all computations are analytically correct, some of the expressions are still unnecessarily expensive to evaluate.
By further simplifying terms that can be known beforehand to cancel, the computation can be sped up drastically.
So far, when final runtime-complexities have been stated, it was assumed that the optimizations in this section would be implemented.
