While at this point all computations are numerically correct, some of the expressions are still unnecessarily expensive to evaluate.
By analytically simplifying terms that can be known beforehand to cancel, the computation can be sped up drastically.
So far, when runtime-complexities have been stated, it was assumed that the optimizations in this section would be implemented.
In the code, always the optimized and the un-optimized version are implemented to check for correctness of simplification and implementation.
E.g. the correctness of the hamiltonian difference is checked to be correct in \filepath{\cite{selfCode}}{/computation-scripts/comparehamiltonians.py}.
