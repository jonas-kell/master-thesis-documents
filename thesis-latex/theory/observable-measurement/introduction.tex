After the derivation in the previous section, it is now possible to obtain a time-evolution of particular wave-function.
However we can not make use of this information directly. 
To gain insight into what is happening, it is necessary to compute \emph{observable quantities} from the wave-function, that can then be compared to substantiate theoretical claims or validate the model with experimental data.
