\cite{originalDerivationTimeDependendVariationalPrinciple} % tdvp historic source
\cite{TDVPcomplexPrefactors} % how to treat complex pre-factors, complex differentiation avoided through real differentiation
\cite{complexDifferentiation} % in this case the complex derivative is fine
\cite{probabilitySamplingRequirementVCN} % VCN general derivation, eta dot derivation and that it needs to sample from the probability distribution of the current state(t)
\cite{variationalClassicalNetworksPaper} % Also source that does the same derivation on different system
