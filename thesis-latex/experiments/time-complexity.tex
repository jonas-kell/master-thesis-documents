At multiple times in te theoretical derivation idealized time-complexities have been stated.
In practice, different hardware-related factors might come into play.
The code to verify the correctness of the simplifications is timed to allow for basic verification of the announced runtime complexities.

            Plot of a comparison of runtimes for calculating the difference of effective Hamiltonians for an arbitrary amount of randomly generated states for the three different described local modifications. 
            The solid lines show the approximate time-dependency of the optimized version of the calculation function on the number of sites in the system.
            The dashed lines show the same for the un-optimized version.
            The graph includes measurements for first (O1) and second order (O2) perturbation theory and for a first order variational classical network (VNC).
