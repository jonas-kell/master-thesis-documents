The system in question is described by a \emph{Hubbard Model Hamiltonian}, that includes an electrical field. It is shown in \autoref{eq:main-hamiltonian}.


\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:main-hamiltonian}
    \pictureHamiltonian = \HzeroHamiltonian + \Vhamiltonian
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:main-hamiltonian-h0}
    \HzeroHamiltonian = U \cdot \lsum \nop{l}{\up}\nop{l}{\down} + \lsum[l,\,\sigma] \underbrace{\left(\vec{E} \cdot \vec{r_l}\right)}_{\text{\normalsize \epsl}} \nop{l}{\sigma}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:main-hamiltonian-pertubation}
    \Vhamiltonian =  - J \cdot \neighborsumWSpin{l}{m}{\sigma} \left(\withspinop{l}{\sigma}{\dagger} \withspinop{m}{\sigma}{} + \withspinop{m}{\sigma}{\dagger} \withspinop{l}{\sigma}{} \right)
\end{equation}

$\vec{E}$ describes the vector of said electrical field and $\vec{r_l}$ the position of the site with index $l$.
The number operators $\nop{l}{\sigma} = \withspinop{l}{\sigma}{\dagger}\withspinop{l}{\sigma}{}$ measure the occupation on site $l$ with the respective spin $\sigma$. 

$U$, $J$ and \epsl[] are constants that describe the interaction strength. 
They all have the unit of energy. 
The scalar Product that is defined as \epsl[] can be evaluated, based on the system geometry. 
In this case, the system described by a regular square pattern that can be seen in \autoref{fig:geometry-of-square-system}. 
For such a system, the energy difference that is acquired from hopping from site $l$ to $m$ ($\Delta E_{l \rightarrow m}$) (provided, $l$ and $m$ are nearest neighbors) is described by \autoref{eq:energy-difference-hopping}. By assuming a default value for \epsl[0] one gets the relation from \autoref{eq:epsl} for \epsl{} (using the telescoping sum over nearest-neighbors-hopping along the path from $\vec{r_0}$ to $\vec{r_l}$).

    \caption{Graphical representation of how the examined square system is laid out. The sites are labeled with the index $l$ they later can be identified by. Each of the sites has 4 nearest neighbors, except the ones on the borders, that have 3 or only 2 nearest neighbors (as the system is not periodic). A system of side-length $M$ with size $N$ is depicted, which means that it has $M^2 = N$ sites.
    In green, the Electrical field vector $\vec{E}$ is depicted, it is parametrized by the field strength $E$ and the angle $\varphi$.}

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:energy-difference-hopping}
    \begin{split}
        \Delta E_{l \rightarrow m} &=  \epsl[m] - \epsl[l] = \vec{E} \cdot \left(\vec{r_m}-\vec{r_l}\right)\\
        &= E \cdot \left[\cos(\varphi)\cdot \left(m \% M-l \% M\right) + \sin(\varphi)\cdot \left(\floor[\bigg]{\frac{m}{M}}-\floor[\bigg]{\frac{l}{M}}\right)\right]
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
\vspace{0.5cm} % equations are not well enough separated otherwise % TODO check in final render
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:epsl}
    \begin{split}
        \epsl[0] = 0 \Rightarrow
        \epsl[l] &= \epsl[l] - \epsl[0] = \Delta E_{0 \rightarrow x} + \dots + \Delta E_{y \rightarrow l}\\
        &= E \cdot \left[\cos(\varphi)\cdot l \% M + \sin(\varphi)\cdot \floor[\bigg]{\frac{l}{M}}\right]
    \end{split}
\end{equation}

The Hubbard Model \cite{hubbardModelOriginalDerivation} is a spin-depending quantum-mechanical model. 
Because of this, the Hamiltonian includes terms for both the spin directions $\up$ and $\down$ (most of the time denoted by a summation over $\sigma$).

For ease of notation (most importantly in the code), the two spin degrees of freedom may be described by the alternate naming scheme provided in \autoref{eq:alt-naming-scheme}.

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:alt-naming-scheme}
    \withspinop{l}{\up}{(\dagger)} \leftrightarrow \cop{l}{(\dagger)}
    \qquad\qquad
    \withspinop{l}{\down}{(\dagger)} \leftrightarrow \dop{l}{(\dagger)}
\end{equation}

For simplification purposes, the two spin directions are assumed to have the same coupeling constants ($U$, $J$ and \epsl).
