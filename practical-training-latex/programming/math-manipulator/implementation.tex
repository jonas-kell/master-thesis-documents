The Math-Manipulator project was implemented in the programming Language \emph{Typescript} and fully compiles down to an application that can be natively used in every modern browser.

More information on the project can be found on its GitHub-page \cite{selfMathManipulator}.
The application is hosted on GitHub-pages, so no installation knowledge is required to try it. 
The program includes an interactive-playground tutorial and is also available as an extension in the code-editor \emph{Visual Studio Code} as an extension.
