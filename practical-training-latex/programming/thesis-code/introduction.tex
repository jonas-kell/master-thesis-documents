A missing part of the report is, how and what results were obtained that describe the 

\bigo{\text{\#}(\text{nearest neighbors})} calculation of $\HeffOft[\tilde{N}]-\HeffOft[N]$ needed in \fullref{sec:theory-special-cases}.

Like previously hinted, they consist of many repetitive terms.
Therefore listing them here would just unnecessarily bloat the report and serve no further purpose.
It is better to look at the generating script 
\filepath{\cite{selfCode}}{/calculation-helpers/simplificationtermhelper.py}
and the generated output script if one desires a specific term from it:

\filepath{\cite{selfCode}}{/computation-scripts/analyticalcalcfunctions.py}.

The algorithm that the script operates on, is explained in the accompanying Project Work Presentation  \cite{selfDocument}.
The validity of the analytical simplifications was tested by direct comparison to the non-simplified terms.
The checking script can be verified here:\\
