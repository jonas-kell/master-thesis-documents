            \item Can give benefits that paper lacks
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Copy/Paste
                \item Collaborate
                \item Convert to text
                \item Searching and ordering large amounts of notes

            \item HOWEVER
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Still no proper automatization
                \item Easily access is lost when using proprietary technology
                \item "Vendor-Locking"

            Always export to a standard format (like pdf) for manual backup!

            Great danger of Vendor-Locking, losing access
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Cloud-Driven offers do not work without internet
                \item Often times even tied to the device (Apple-Notes I-pad, personal experience with one-note)
                \item Countless stories about providers ending support, users getting blocked and more

            Conclusion: very great choice to boost productivity. But TIP: archive everything as pdf if you ever plan to use it later. It may save you weeks of work/complete loss of data.
